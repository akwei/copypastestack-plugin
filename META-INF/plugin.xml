  <description><![CDATA[
      Adds a tool window of copy history items, similar to the standard copy history built-in,
      but possible to be kept persistently open and with some additional features:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Copy/paste stack provides an unlimited long list of of copied string items, from the current and recent sessions.
            Copy/paste stack caches its content, allowing you to keep copied items for as long as needed
            (instead of limiting their availability to the current editing session).
        </li>
        <li>The full text of selected copied items can optionally be previewed in an editable text pane.</li>
        <li>One or multiple selected items can be inserted into the editor via [ENTER] key, [SPACE] or double click.</li>
        <li>Items are automatically trimmed from surrounding whitespace.</li>
        <li>The list of copied items can be sorted chronologically and alphabetically</li>
        <li>Previously copied items can be re-copied to the regular clipboard again</li>
        <li>Items in the copy stack can be color tagged with a yellow, green or red background</li>
        <li>When pasting items back into the editor, they can be wrapped with a prefix and postfix string,
            and a delimiter when pasting multiple items at once.
        </li>
      </ul>
